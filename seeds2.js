        description:"I was lucky enough to meet Mike outside the Guildhall in Portsmouth on his 5 miles out tour. I asked a bouncer for his autograph and he said he will see what he can do. five minutes later, Mike appears so I ask him to sign my album cover with which he said, 'can you hold my guitar whilst I sign it for you ?' I put his guitar around my neck whilst he signed. he then said 'thank you for coming to see me' and gave me his plectrum before going back inside. I was stunned and I was the only person there as it was only around 5 o'clock.......A real gentleman and artist. Thank you mike and if you ever read this, i'm forever grateful that you took the time to say hello to me......",
