        description:"You know, the more I listen to many of Monk's recordings, the more I appreciate the symbiosis between Monk and tenor sax Charlie Rouse, who to me is one of the most underrated musicians of the bebop era and beyond.  And Butch Warren on bass with Ben Riley here, they too deserve great credit. You don't get people to play with Monk who don't have their stuff together.   I realize that here, they're in Paris doing a festival, and a lot of old favorites, but that soul connection between Monk & Rouse still stands out to me.  They go back, brothers & sisters!  And bless them and their enormous talents--   They bring us forward!",

        description:"Today is friday. Since a while ago, fridays have this special flavor, because I adopted a ritual where I devote the afternoon and night for throwing a deep dive into myself. Today is the day where I disconnect from the outer world, to connect with my inner one. This ritual has been of increasingly importance the last weeks, and it feels good. It makes me feel alive. It makes me feel grateful. I have never heard this album but I know that it will be important. I know where it comes from, I did my research, so I'm really looking forward to experiencing it with all the cells of my body. Thanks Giles for creating this music. I will enjoy it.",

        description: "In my history class this year, an assignment was given where we had to talk to our Grandparents and ask them questions about there past, younger self. I thought it was a dumb assignment at the time, but i cant tell you how much i appreciate it now. I interviewed my grandpa. We had a sheet with a list of questions to ask. I remember propping up my phone recorder so i can re listen to what he said to type the paper out later on. My grandpa grew up in grand rapids Michigan and lived in your average suburban neighborhood. His mother was very kind, sweet woman. His father on the other hand, was troubled and had a difficult time expressing his feelings. He told me that when he was little hed often play with the neighborhood kids, but every year a circus would come downtown, and him and his brother would often go down there to watch. One time they met the owner of the circus who pretty much asked them 'hey kids wanna job?' so they helped tend to the elephants. I asked him if he ever played an instrument. It took him a long while to remember. He told me he always wanted to play the trumpet for school, but it cost 45 cents a week to rent, and when he asked his father, he yelled and told him they didnt have that kind of money. He was very sad, i could see the regret in his face when he told me this. Broke my heart. He also told me about what music he likes, its this classic stuff. He loves jazz and Mozart too. Maybe this is why this hits so hard for me. He went on to tell me about his favorite books, and other memorys he could remember. Ill never forget how long it took him sometimes. We had to skip a couple questions. He didnt know the answer to his own life story. As we were rapping things up i asked him what his favorite memory was. He told me it was playing baseball with my stepdad. 'Matt would look at me and say: please we need another player and what was i supposed to do? ...Thats alot of pressure!' That was my favorite one too. My grandpa dosent have dementia, he isnt sick, but hes still old. Hes still forgetting. I didnt understand at the time why we need to do this project, but after listening to Everything At the End of Time, i can tell you why: To help them remember. Everytime i see a trumpet, ill think of you, grandpa Larry. Love you.",
